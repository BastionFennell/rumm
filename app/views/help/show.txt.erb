Rumm: A tasty tool for hackers and pirates
  Rumm provides a command line interface for hacking with Rackspace. The
  only thing you'll need to get started is a username and password from
  your Rackspace hosting account. e.g.

    rumm login
    Username: rsteveson
    Password: ******
    logged in as rstevenson, credentials written to ~/.netrc

  And you're good to go! For a list of all commands, run:

    rumm help commands
