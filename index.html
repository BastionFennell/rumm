    <h2>rumm Basics</h2>
    <p>Authentication: Before you can use rumm, you'll need a <a href="http://rackspace.com/cloud">Rackspace Cloud</a> account. It's free to sign up. rumm is self-configuring - just use the <span class="italic">login</span> command.</p>

<pre>
rumm login
  <span class="output">username: rstevenson
  password: *********
  logged in, credentials written to ~/.netrc</span>
</pre>

    <p>After logging in for hte first tie, rumm will save your API credentials in ~/.netrc.</p>
    <p>You now have access to all of your Rackspace Cloud assets - servers, databases, files, images, etc.</p>

<pre>
rumm create server
  <span class="output">--> bootstrapping server sorrel-shantung
      done.</span></span>

rumm show servers
  <span class="output">sorrel-shantung -> id: f89c4f57-f66b-4a14-aae2-e3dedf7f59b2, status: ACTIVE, ipv4: 166.78.111.48</span>

    <h2>Under the Hood</h2>
    <p>rumm is built on the <a href="http://github.com/cowboyd/mvcli">MVCLI framework</a>. Much like Ruby on Rails was extracted from the development of Basecamp, MVCLI was extracted from the development of rumm. MVCLI can be thought of as "Rails for command line tools", and consists of a MVC-like Ruby framework that Rails developers will find familiar.</p>

    <p>The heavy lifting of the Rackspace OpenStack API is handled by <a href="http://fog.io">fog</a>.</p>

    <h2>Plugins</h2>
    <p>
      But wait, there's more! MVCLI was built from the ground up to allow for plugin development. Much like a Rails Engine, an MVCLI plugin is a gem that has its own models, views and controllers that can be used to extend the functionality of any MVCLI application, including rumm.
    </p>
    <p>
      MVCLI does not yet support plugins, but it will soon. In the mean time, the 'railsify server' command curently built into rumm is a good example of what a plugin can do. 'railsify server' will install your entire Ruby on Rails production stack onto a cloud sever with one command! It's not currently a plugin, but it will be extracted into one as soon as the support is there.
